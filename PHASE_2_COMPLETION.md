```

## Platform Compatibility

- ✅ **macOS**: Fully tested and working
- ⏳ **Windows**: Should work (standard Electron compatibility)
- ⏳ **Linux**: Should work (standard Electron compatibility)

## Next Steps: Phase 3

Phase 2 now provides an advanced foundation that exceeds original Phase 3 goals. Remaining Phase 3 items:
