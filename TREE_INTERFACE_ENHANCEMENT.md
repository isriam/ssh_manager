## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
```html
<div class="tree-container">
  <div class="tree-node group-node expanded" data-group="work">
    <div class="tree-node-header">
      <span class="tree-toggle">‚ñº</span>
      <span class="group-icon">üíº</span>
      <span class="group-name">Work</span>
    </div>
    <div class="tree-children" data-group="work">
      <!-- Connection items populated dynamically -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### CSS Features
- **Drag Visual States**: `.dragging`, `.drag-over` classes for feedback
- **Tree Hierarchy**: Proper indentation and connecting lines
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different window sizes
- **Professional Styling**: Consistent with overall application theme

### JavaScript Functionality
- **Dynamic Rendering**: `renderTreeConnections()` populates tree from backend data

- **Group Operations**: Move connections between groups with backend sync
- **Selection Management**: Track and highlight selected connections

## User Workflow

### Moving Connections
1. **Select Connection**: Click and drag any SSH connection from the tree

## Testing Completed

### Manual Testing ‚úÖ
- Tree structure renders correctly with existing connections
- Drag and drop moves connections between groups
- Backend properly updates SSH config files
- Visual feedback works during drag operations
- Selection and detail view functioning properly
- Search filters connections across all groups

### Current Test Data
```
Work Group:
  - jump-host (ubuntu@bastion.company.com:22)
  - work-server (devops@10.0.1.50:2222)

Personal Group:
  - test (asdf@test:22)

Projects Group:
  - client-web (deploy@web.client.com:22)
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing Phase 1 and Phase 2 functionality preserved
